# Project Name

A Next.js project with Tailwind CSS, Axios for API calls, and SCSS integration.

## Description

This is a template for setting up a Next.js project with a powerful combination of technologies, including Tailwind CSS for styling, Axios for making API requests, and SCSS for flexible and modular styling. This project structure promotes clean code organization and fast development.

## Project Structure

The project follows a common code structure that separates code into different directories for better organization:

- `components`: Reusable UI components.
- `containers`: Components that encapsulate business logic and data.
- `pages`: React components that correspond to different routes.
- `services`: Helper functions, API calls, and other services.
- `layouts`: Shared layout components for consistent page structure.
- `styles`: SCSS files for global and component-specific styling.

## Features

- Next.js with TypeScript for server-rendered React applications and static typing.
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- Axios for making API calls.
- SCSS for flexible and modular styling.
- Routing with Next.js's built-in routing system.
- Responsive design out-of-the-box with Tailwind CSS.
- Easy configuration and customization of styles with SCSS.
- Fast development and hot-reloading with Next.js.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project-name.git
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the project in action.

## Customization

- You can customize the Tailwind CSS styles in the `tailwind.config.js` file.
- Add your own components, pages, and styles in their respective directories.

## API Calls with Axios

- Axios is set up for making API calls in the `services/api.js` file. You can modify the base URL and add your API endpoints.

## Styling with SCSS

- Global styles and variables can be defined in the `styles/styles.module.scss` file.
- You can import component-specific SCSS files directly into your components for styling.

## Deployment

To deploy this project, follow the deployment instructions for Next.js applications. You may choose platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred hosting solution.

### Project Structure Details

- **components**: This directory contains reusable UI components. You can organize components based on their functionality or use case.

- **containers**: Container components typically encapsulate business logic and data handling for a specific feature. They are often connected to the state management system (e.g., Redux) and serve as a bridge between the UI components and data services.

- **pages**: In Next.js, each component in this directory corresponds to a different route in your application. These components are responsible for rendering the actual pages your users will interact with.

- **services**: The services directory is where you can place helper functions, API calls, and other services needed by your application. These services can be used by both components and containers.

- **layouts**: Layout components provide a consistent structure for your pages. They often contain common elements like headers, footers, and navigation menus. By using layouts, you can maintain a unified design throughout your application.

- **styles**: The styles directory contains SCSS files for styling. You can define global styles and import them into your components for styling.
